# CandleVision

ðŸ”­ currently working on

In our project, CandleVision, we plan to integrate computer vision and AI, emphasizing the importance of candlestick patterns in financial market analysis. By incorporating sentiment analysis, our goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible understanding of market trends for traders of various skill levels. The combination of advanced computer vision and detailed analysis of candlestick patterns aims to simplify and improve trading decision-making. CandleVision is poised to demonstrate how AI can offer deeper insights and a more informed approach to analyzing financial markets.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

In our project, CandleVision, will utilize combination of advanced computer vision and detailed analysis of candlestick patterns with aims of simplify and improving trading decision-making. CandleVision is poised to demonstrate how AI and Machine learning can offer deeper insights and a more informed approach to analyzing financial markets.

Here's why:
* New investor lack fundemental knowledge of candlesticks and market patterns
* fundementals are key in identifying market movement
* Solid foundation will teach and prevent guessing the market and capital blowout

Of course, this is not a funancial advising but just a tool to help investors!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is how you begin setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
### Environment Setup
* ```python install -m venv venv```
```.venv\Scripts\activate   ``` 

### Installation
* ```pip install -r requirements```
      
### Running the server:
* ```uvicorn app.main:app --reload```


### Technology Stack

- Data Ingestion: Yahoo finance API, X, News medias

- Visualizing Data: TradingView API, Pine Scriptâ„¢ v5, Python (Plotly, Matplotlib, statsmodel)

- Processing Data: Panda and Numpy may be used to manage data and clean up
